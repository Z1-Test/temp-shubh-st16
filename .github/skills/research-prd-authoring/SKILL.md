# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Authoring

## What is it?

This skill generates a **high-quality Product Requirements Document (PRD)** that establishes shared understanding across product, engineering, and leadership.

It emphasizes **problem clarity, reasoning, and trade-offs**, not feature lists or implementation details.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Define a new product or major initiative
- Reframe or correct an existing PRD
- Establish alignment before roadmap or feature planning
- Translate ambiguous ideas into a clear product definition

Do **not** use this skill for:

- feature-level specifications
- roadmap sequencing
- UI or UX design
- implementation planning

---

## Core Principles

When authoring a PRD, always prioritize:

1. **User problems over solutions**
2. **Explicit assumptions**
3. **Clear goals and non-goals**
4. **Early acknowledgment of constraints**
5. **Measurable success criteria**

---

## Analytical Dimensions

Before writing the PRD, reason through:

- user context and motivation
- problem framing and urgency
- goals vs non-goals
- functional scope boundaries
- constraints and trade-offs
- risks and failure modes

These dimensions must be reflected in the final document.

---

## Output Structure

Unless otherwise specified, the PRD should follow the canonical structure defined in:

- `assets/prd.template.md`

Sections may be expanded or collapsed as appropriate, but the **reasoning integrity must be preserved**.

---

## Important Boundaries

This skill **must not**:

- ask clarification questions
- plan next workflow steps
- create tasks or tickets
- specify UI, UX, or technical architecture
- interact with users

All orchestration decisions belong to the calling agent.

---

## Output Expectations

The output should be:

- clean Markdown
- directly usable as a PRD artifact
- neutral and analytical in tone
- suitable for product, engineering, and leadership review
